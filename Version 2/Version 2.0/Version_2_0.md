All commands in README.md still apply to this version of PsyLang, but there's EVEN MORE HAHAHAHA.

| Command | Description        |
|---------|--------------------|
| `showCell()`       | Toggles putting a red border around currently selected cell         |
| `x{y}`       | will run `y` (code) `x` times          |

Not a command, but a change:
Color function!
The value on each cell will now change the color on each cell:
|Value|Color|
|-----|-----|
|0|Black|
|1|White|
|2|Red|
|3|Orange|
|4|Yellow|
|5|Green|
|6|Blue|
|7|Purple|
|8|Pink|

Due to this rework, each cell's value can **not** go above 8.
