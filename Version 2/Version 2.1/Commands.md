This is version 2, but with 2 new commands:
|Command|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|`%[x/y]`|Will generate a random number between `x` and `y`, including `x` and `y`. Can be placed where numbers normally go|
|`$[x][y]`|Every `x` seconds, run `y` (code)|

Now, you can make some pretty cool things with the abomonation against God that is PsyLang.
